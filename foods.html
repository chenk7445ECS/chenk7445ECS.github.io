  <h1>3 of My Favorite Foods</h1>
  <p>Steak is one of my 3 favorite foods. When cooked correctly, it can look very appetizing sometimes and it can taste very good too. It's basically cow that has been cooked so that it can be very flavorful. Its high quality beef that was cut from the hindquarters of a cow.</p>

  <p>Sushi is very good Asian Food. It is usually wrapped in seaweed and in the inside is usaully served with rice and fish. Most of the times the fish is raw and uncooked. Some other ingredients and sushi can be egg or vegetables.</p>
