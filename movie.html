  <h1>Spider Man Homecoming Synopis</h1>
  <p>Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May. Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine -- distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just a friendly neighborhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the evil Vulture emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear.</p>
  <h1>Personal Review</h1>
  <p>I thought Spider-Man homecoming was a pretty interesting movie. It combined the character with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Peter Parker is then mentored by Tony Stark/Iron Man. The villain is also quite interesting becuase he happens to be the father of Peter's girlfriend.The movie was action packed and very suspenseful.</p>
