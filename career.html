<p style="color:#8744C5;">My Future Career</p>
<html>
<body>
<p>When I grow up, I want to be either a software or hardware engineer for Microsoft, Google or Apple. These jobs I all have an interest in. For software engineering, I like to program and design pages, and for hardware, I love to design an build an amazing design for anything like a tablet, phone, or laptop.</p>
<p>My plan to get to my future career is to hopefully go to MIT so I can a degree in Computer Science or in Engineering so I can do a job that requires those.I would have to take the computer science courses at CCA so I can become well informed of the information I need for the job. For my job, I would need to design software interfaces and design the hardware of devices. The estimated salary per year is about 110k.
